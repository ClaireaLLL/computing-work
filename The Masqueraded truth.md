The Masqueraded Truth
  
  Lilth couldn't remember much. She lay on her bed, watching the servents find her a perfect dress whilst thinking long and hard. Even though she was rich, her life has never been the fantasies she has ever known. At least, the fantasies she has envisioned. *I never knew all these fantasies would get me depressed*, she thought. The party was an hour away. She had to find out before then.
  "Lilth! The limousine's here." 
  
  Her white satin gown ran down her knees, with a bow securing her belt in place. The blonde teen looked around, desperately trying to look for clues. Just then, a young man ever so charming carelessly spilled a glass of wine right smack on her gown.
  "Oh... my apologies, I'll help clean that up,"
  "Don't fret, I've brought an extra dress!" Lilth's mom stepped in between the two.
  "I'll escort you to the ladies'," the mysterious man offered.
  
  On the way to the toilet, Lilth found the man's aura getting yet stronger and stronger. 
  "Sorry to bother you but, may I know your name?" Lilth asked hesitantly.
  "Well it would be rude if I didn't introduce myself to such an elegant lady," he smiled a litle, "I'm Zion."
  "Oh that's nice... I'm-"
  "Lilth, right? Lilth." Zion interrupted.
  "Y-you know me?" 
  "Why wouldn't I?"
  "I-I'll go change first."
  
  "Wait! Before that..." Zion exclaimed, grabbing her wrist,"Will you please follow me, Lilth?"
  *What does he want from me?!* Lilth thought. She found herself at a loss, the only time she wished her mother was with her.
  "I can help you look for clues, " He calmly replied.
  That was all Lilth needed to know. The clues would lead her to the answers. And that, she knew she had fallen into the right handsome. 
  "I'll go with you."
  Zion eased his grip and ran, Lilth right after him. 
  
  They found themselves in the woods away from the club. There was a flash of light, followed by another, another and another. Then, all was finally calm and the world around Lilth faded into nothing.
  
  (Ok so this part is like 10 years ago, where both remembers everything but Lilth forgets the present but they are still the same age dont ask why)
  
  "Ugh, what just happened? Where am I???" Lilth asked, massaging her head. 
  "Oh... we're in a forest." Lilth scanned the area. 
  "Hey Zion, isn't this a lovely pla-" 
  Zion woke up right beside her at that moment. 
  "Lilth Wilson, there's no time to waste! I need you to recall your memories!" He towered over Lilth, gripping her arm. His pale blue eyes met Lilth's.
  Lilth thought long and hard as Zion continued to give her a cold, threatening stare. Then, visions came into her mind, the bloodiest thing she had ever seen. There seemed to be a war.
  "N-no!" Cried Lilth, as if she was met with reality. 
  
  "What. Did you see. Just now?" Zion began shaking her violently, demanding for the answers. 
  *What's his problem?* Lilth started to question.
  "I don't remember a thing... but what was that image in my head just now? Was that... ugh, I don't know."
  Lilth could not remember. Exausted, she fell into Zion's arms in a daze, Zion catching her just on time.
  
  "AHHHHHHH where the heck am I?" Lilth sprang out of bed. 
  "AHHHHHHH this isn't my room..." 
  "AHHHHHHH Who's clothes am I in?!" 
  "Ugh, could you shut up?" A teenage girl around her age broke into her room. 
  "I'm really sorry, uh..." Lilth got off the bed and approached her.
  "Don't touch me! UUUeegH! (Very strange screech) My makeup's fresh!"
  "I-"
  "What? Why are you looking at me like this? Oh, ya jealous?" The trying girl twirlled her fringe around her finger, making pityful faces at Lilth.
  Lilth was outraged.
  "Why do you care, b_tch?"
  "Oh, you called me a b_tch? HA, yea that's clever, I'm a B_TCH! HAHAHAHAHAHA..."
  
  "Just LEAVE HER ALONE!" A slender boy stepped foot into Lilth's bedroom. Before anyone could react, icicles grew from the ceiling, wrapping around the bully's neck, arms and legs. 
  "AAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHH!!!!!!" She screamed at the top of her lungs, while Lilth watched in amusement as the suffocating girl's face turned purple, then red, then white.
  "Don't worry about Siera," Zion came in and put his arm around Lilth's shoulders.
  "She's really a pain in the a**," he lamented. 
  Lilth remained silent.
  "What's wrong sweetie?"
  "Uh... Zion, don't you think... that's a bit too much for Siera?" Lilth's amusement turned into horror. 
  "Are your memories recovering, Lilth?" asked Zion as he changed the subject. 
  *They are, actually.* Thought Lilth. She started remembering the pain she has gone through trying to stand the brat.
  She nodded. 
  "Good," said Zion, "I'm bringing you to go meet the king."
  Lilth nodded sadly, whispering a soft apology to Siera's motionless body lying on the floor.
  
  Zion paced his steps and stood merely an inch apart from Lilth. She felt a little uncomfortable, of course. *But he's trying his best for me,* Lilth thought.
  Lilth was escorted to a great big ceremonial hall. There, she found the entrance to the throne. 
  "I'll wait here for you," Zion nodded. 
  Lilth took a deep breath. She looked down and stared at her leathered training attire, completed with a pre-tied scarf around her neck. She knew what was coming. 
  Performing a small curtsey, king Adiona gave a wide and cheery smile. To Lilth, it was... somewhat more genuine than Zion's. She liked it.

  "My saviour," king Adiona acknowledged the curtsey, "Welcome back."
  "You remember me right?" he questioned, just to make sure.
  "I do, king Adiona. Our victory was certainly a miracle." 
  "Well you were clearly the miracle."
  "Thank you, your highness," Lilth bowed with much dignity.
  "Speaking about that, how was your short break after the battle?"
  
  Lilth hesitated. About the short break, she discovered that she had forgotten about her plans, and her unfinished business. Having such a normal life that bussied her so much from what was important, it was a risk to say that everything was smooth-sailing again.
  
  "Great. My break was great. I (fake giggles) did have a fruitful stay at my mother's. Just. Great. Yeah."
  For some reason, king Adiona did not seem to buy it. He titled his head a little, and stared at Lilth, not satisfied with her answer.
  "Please elaborate. After all, the break was a gift for all the commitment you've put in."
  "I, uh-"
