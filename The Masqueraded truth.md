The Masqueraded Truth
  
  Lilth couldn't remember much. She lay on her bed, watching the servents find her a perfect dress whilst thinking long and hard. Her life has never been the fantasies she have ever known. *I never knew all these fantasies would get me depressed*, she thought. The party was an hour away. She had to find out before then.
  "Lilth! The limousine's here." 
  
  Her white gown ran down her knees, with a bow securing her belt in place. The blonde teen looked around, desperately trying to look for clues. Just then, a young man ever so charming carelessly spilled a glass of wine right smack on her gown.
  "Oh... my apologies, I'll help clean that up,"
  "Don't fret, I've brought an extra dress!" Lilth's mom stepped in between the two.
  "I'll escort you to the ladies'," the mysterious man offered.
  
  On the way to the toilet, Lilth found the man's aura getting yet stronger and stronger. 
  "Sorry to bother you but, may I know your name?" Lilth asked hesitantly.
  "Well it would be rude if I didn't introduce myself to such an elegant lady," he smiled a litle, "I'm Zion."
  "Oh that's nice... I'm-"
  "Lilth, right? Lilth." Zion interrupted.
  "Y-you know me?" 
  "Why wouldn't I?"
  "I-I'll go change first."
  
  "Wait! Before that..." Zion exclaimed, grabbing her wrist,"Will you please follow me, Lilth?"
  *What does he want from me?!* Lilth thought. She found herself at a loss, the only time she wished her mother was with her.
  "I can help you look for clues, " He calmly replied.
  That was all Lilth needed to know. The clues would lead her to the answers. And that, she knew she had fallen into the right handsome. 
  "I'll go with you."
  Zion eased his grip and ran, Lilth right after him. 
  
  They found themselves in the woods away from the club. There was a flash of light, followed by another, another and another. Then, all was finally calm and the world around Lilth faded into nothing.
  
  (Ok so this part is like 10 years ago, where both remembers everything but Lilth forgets the present but they are still the same age dont ask why)
  
  "Ugh, what just happened? Where am I???" Lilth asked, massaging her head. 
  "Oh... we're in a forest." Lilth scanned the area. 
  "Hey Zion, isn't this a lovely pla-" 
  Zion woke up right beside her at that moment. 
  "Lilth Wilson, there's no time to waste! I need you to recall your memories!" He towered over Lilth, gripping her arm. His pale blue eyes met Lilth's.
  Lilth thought long and hard as Zion continued to give her a cold, threatening stare. Then, visions came into her mind, the bloodiest thing she had ever seen. There seemed to be a war.
  "N-no!" Cried Lilth, as if she was met with reality. 
  
  "What. Did you see. Just now?" Zion began shaking her violently, demanding for the answers. 
  *What's his problem?* Lilth started to question.
  "I don't remember a thing... but what was that image in my head just now? Was that... death?"
  "Good job Lilth, that's a good girl." Zion nodded his head and pulled Lilth into a tight embrace. "Good, you've done well..." Zion's mellow voice trailed off as Lilth went into his arms. She
