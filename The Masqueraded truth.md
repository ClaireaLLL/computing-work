The Masqueraded Truth
  
  Lilth couldn't remember much. She lay on her bed, watching the servents find her a perfect dress whilst thinking long and hard. Even though she was rich, her life has never been the fantasies she has ever known. At least, the fantasies she has envisioned. *I never knew all these fantasies would get me depressed*, she thought. The party was an hour away. She had to find out before then.
  "Lilth! The limousine's here." 
  
  Her white satin gown ran down her knees, with a bow securing her belt in place. The blonde teen looked around, desperately trying to look for clues. Just then, a young man ever so charming carelessly spilled a glass of wine right smack on her gown.
  "Oh... my apologies, I'll help clean that up,"
  "Don't fret, I've brought an extra dress!" Lilth's mom stepped in between the two.
  "I'll escort you to the ladies'," the mysterious man offered.
  
  On the way to the toilet, Lilth found the man's aura getting yet stronger and stronger. 
  "Sorry to bother you but, may I know your name?" Lilth asked hesitantly.
  "Well it would be rude if I didn't introduce myself to such an elegant lady," he smiled a litle, "I'm Zion."
  "Oh that's nice... I'm-"
  "Lilth, right? Lilth." Zion interrupted.
  "Y-you know me?" 
  "Why wouldn't I?"
  "I-I'll go change first."
  
  "Wait! Before that..." Zion exclaimed, grabbing her wrist,"Will you please follow me, Lilth?"
  *What does he want from me?!* Lilth thought. She found herself at a loss, the only time she wished her mother was with her.
  "I can help you look for clues, " He calmly replied.
  That was all Lilth needed to know. The clues would lead her to the answers. And that, she knew she had fallen into the right handsome. 
  "I'll go with you."
  Zion eased his grip and ran, Lilth right after him. 
  
  They found themselves in the woods away from the club. There was a flash of light, followed by another, another and another. Then, all was finally calm and the world around Lilth faded into nothing.
  
  (Ok so this part is like 10 years ago, where both remembers everything but Lilth forgets the present but they are still the same age dont ask why)
  
  "Ugh, what just happened? Where am I???" Lilth asked, massaging her head. 
  "Oh... we're in a forest." Lilth scanned the area. 
  "Hey Zion, isn't this a lovely pla-" 
  Zion woke up right beside her at that moment. 
  "Lilth Wilson, there's no time to waste! I need you to recall your memories!" He towered over Lilth, gripping her arm. His black, demonic eyes met Lilth's.
  Lilth thought long and hard as Zion continued to give her a cold, threatening stare. Then, visions came into her mind, the bloodiest thing she had ever seen. There seemed to be a war.
  "N-no!" Cried Lilth, as if she was met with reality. 
  
  "What. Did you see. Just now?" Zion began shaking her violently, demanding for the answers. 
  *What's his problem?* Lilth started to question.
  "I don't remember a thing... but what was that image in my head just now? Was that... ugh, I don't know."
  Lilth could not remember. Exausted, she fell into Zion's arms in a daze, Zion catching her just on time.
  
  "AHHHHHHH where the heck am I?" Lilth sprang out of bed. 
  "AHHHHHHH this isn't my room..." 
  "AHHHHHHH Who's clothes am I in?!" 
  "Ugh, could you shut up?" A teenage girl around her age broke into her room. 
  "I'm really sorry, uh..." Lilth got off the bed and approached her.
  "Don't touch me! UUUeegH! (Very strange screech) My makeup's fresh!"
  "I-"
  "What? Why are you looking at me like this? Oh, ya jealous?" The trying girl twirlled her fringe around her finger, making pityful faces at Lilth.
  Lilth was outraged.
  "Why do you care, b_tch?"
  "Oh, you called me a b_tch? HA, yea that's clever, I'm a B_TCH! HAHAHAHAHAHA..."
  
  "Just LEAVE HER ALONE!" A slender boy stepped foot into Lilth's bedroom. Before anyone could react, thorns grew from the ceiling, wrapping around the bully's neck, arms and legs. 
  "AAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHH!!!!!!" She screamed at the top of her lungs, while Lilth watched in amusement as the suffocating girl's face turned purple, then red, then white.
  "Don't worry about Siera," Zion came in and put his arm around Lilth's shoulders.
  "She's really a pain in the a**," he lamented. 
  Lilth remained silent.
  "What's wrong sweetie?"
  "Uh... Zion, don't you think... that's a bit too much for Siera?" Lilth's amusement turned into horror. 
  "Are your memories recovering, Lilth?" asked Zion as he changed the subject. 
  *They are, actually.* Thought Lilth. She started remembering the pain she has gone through trying to stand the brat.
  She nodded. 
  "Good," said Zion, "I'm bringing you to go meet the king."
  Lilth nodded sadly, whispering a soft apology to Siera's motionless body lying on the floor.
  
  Zion paced his steps and stood merely an inch apart from Lilth. She felt a little uncomfortable, of course. *But he's trying his best for me,* Lilth thought.
  Lilth was escorted to a great big ceremonial hall. There, she found the entrance to the throne. 
  "I'll wait here for you," Zion nodded. 
  Lilth took a deep breath. She looked down and stared at her leathered training attire, completed with a pre-tied scarf around her neck. She knew what was coming. 
  Performing a small curtsey, king Adiona gave a wide and cheery smile. To Lilth, it was... somewhat more genuine than Zion's. She liked it. 
  
(Jesus christ)
  
  "My saviour," king Adiona acknowledged the curtsey, "Welcome back."
  "You remember me right?" he questioned, just to make sure.
  "I do, king Adiona. Our victory was certainly a miracle." 
  "Well you were clearly the miracle."
  "Thank you, your highness," Lilth bowed with much dignity.
  "Speaking about that, how was your short break after the battle?"
  
  Lilth hesitated. About the short break, she discovered that she had forgotten about her plans, and her unfinished business. Having such a normal life that bussied her so much from what was important, it was a risk to say that everything was smooth-sailing again.
  
  "Great. My break was great. I (fake giggles) did have a fruitful stay at my mother's. Just. Great. Yeah."
  For some reason, king Adiona did not seem to buy it. He titled his head a little, and stared at Lilth, not satisfied with her answer.
  "Please elaborate. After all, the break was a gift for all the commitment you've put in."
  "I, uh-"
  
  "YEAIFEOIEAHOIEAOGJHIOAJGIOARHOIJOIJOIJ KING ADIONA!"
  A high-pitched squeal from another end of the hall resonated around the hall. 
  "King Adiona. KING ADIONA!" 
  "What now, Georgia?" asked slightly annoyed king Adiona.
  Georgia raced up to the throne, trying to catch her breath and replied, "Siera's creating a ruckus in the ground floor!"
  
  He let out a great big sigh. 
  "Siera you said?"
  "Yeah. Crashing through all the floors with the thorny-powers all of us have, screaming something that nobody understood."
  "Has anyone tried to stop her?"
  "Uh, we'd best not disturb her-"
  "LILTH! Go resolve the problem."
  
  Lilth felt a little uneasy about king Adiona's unfold of emotions, yet she was much relieved that she could escape his initial question. Georgia led Lilth down the hallway to the corridors on on the ground floor. *Siera must have been really mad about what Zion's done to her earlier on,* she thought. *But it's a good thing that she actually has the ability to ressurect.*
  
  Lilth was met with a new Siera. She looked more like a monster now, destroying everything in her path. Her powers were stronger than ever.
  "Siera, calm down!" cried Lilth, watching Siera continue to topple down lockers. Other than Georgia, there was no one else in sight.
  "Georgia, can you help me on this?" she asked.
  "But I have not learnt how to use my powers yet. I'm quite new."
  Lilth groaned a little inside. *That's fine, I'll handle this myself*. Lilth closed her eyes, imagining the great forces of the thorns. After she opened her eyes again, she felt her body weight resist against the invisible thorns. With all her might, Lilth forced the thorns out of her arm, straightening them out slowly one by one.  
  
(Does this even make sense)
  The thorns eventually reached their maximum length, and were in full control of Lilth. She manoeuvred them over to Siera's face in the middle of the huge thorns surrounding her, slapping it with great strength.
  Siera resisted. She fell back a little on the first slap, but even after the second, third and forth slaps, she got back on her knees. 
  "I hate you," she said in a low, creaky voice.
  Then, thorns from Siera's end slid through Lilth's, coming straight at her.
  Lilth did not flinch. She felt the thorns wrapping around her body, like how Zion did to Siera. *Stay calm*, she thought.
  
  (Harry potter vibes)
  
  Agony. Pain. All virtual feelings. War was just around the corner. "You will never defeat us," he said, "not with all the information I have gained."
  
(At this point its kinda obvious Zion has been, is, and will use her against her during war)
  
  "Wait what.." Lilth opened her eyes. Actual colour came flooding back to her sight, no longer just red and black.
  "Oh, hey there Zion," she said as that was the first thing she saw. Lilth felt herself almost too weak to move, the only thing she could was her mouth. 
  "What happened to Siera, then?" she questioned.
  "Nothing much. She's put in detention now, sucks for her," Zion laughed.
  "Hold on, she did nothing wrong though," Lilth said.
  "Oh yeah, Siera nearly strengled the life out of you, nothing wrong with that."
  Lilth shook her head, "She wasn't the one who started it. It was me. Anyway, we always loose our temper sometimes."
  "But Lilth, you don't *understand* how important your life is. You'll miss out so much have you died then."
  "Guess you're right, Zion." Lilth shrugged.
  She watched Zion's reassuring smile and went back for a short nap.
  
  After a few weeks in the Academy of the knights, Lilth's skills improved significantly, and she was one of the best in her level, in fact.
  "It's a pity you don't have a second power though," king Adiona told her once, "but that's fine."
  Siera has always been really cold around Lilth or anybody who supported her. Of course, Zion, who was from four levels higher than the two, protected Lilth from all the possible harm. She was grateful for Zion being there for her, and of course, their relationship grew closer.
  
(NOT a romantic relationship tho :P)
  
  All has been peaceful ever since the first war. In fact, nobody has talked about it ever since they remained victorious. 
  
  Lilth wanted to go out for some exploration in the forest. (You know the one she first landed in) She called a few closer friends: Alice and Kay with her. 
  Actually, they weren't the closest.
  Alice and Kay are twins, and always accepted Lilth in their team for group projects. Although Lilth was sort of an outcast, she was pleased that everyone was on her side. 
  "So we'll meet in the evening!" 
  "Right, we'll be there."
  
   After that was settled, Lilth went to the upper floor to look for Zion for battling tips. At this point of time, she we already familiar with the Academy and knew every possible spot Zion might be in at each point of time. 
  
  Meanwhile, at king Adiona's throne (did i describe it correctly)
  
  "Zion, I have an important task for you."
  "Sure."
  "As a senior knight in this training school, it would be my pleasure to say you'll be in the first graduating batch, next year."
  "Yeah, I know that..." Zion replied, waiting for him to get to the point.
  "So being in charge of all school grounds and the community, I have realised you've missed out several training sessions." king Adiona said, his voice becoming huskier.
  Zion sheepishly looked away. True that, but he had more important tasks to do.
  "As a result," said king Adiona, "You will be unable to graduate, no matter how strong you are."
  Zion gasped.
  "However, we do have a chance for you to prove that you will be able to,"
  
  
  (DONT EDIT MY STORY LET ME WRITE THE WHOLE THING!! edit: you know what edit if you like)
  (And also this story is in Lilth's perspective and the dude is an a** AND IM MAKING THIS AN EDGY STORY)
  (Right so about these people with thorn-powers, so basically everyone around here has them, as well as some who have second powers. e.g. Zion's teleportation through time, Siera's ability to resurrect)
